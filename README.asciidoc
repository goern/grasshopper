= Grasshopper

Grasshopper is an implementation of the http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/nulecule/[Nulecule Specification]. It can be
used to bootstrap container applications and to install and run them. Grasshopper
is designed to be run in a container context.

== Getting Started

Grasshopper is packaged as a container or as a RPM via https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/goern/grasshopper/[copr].
End-users typically do not install the software from source. Instead use the Grasshopper container as the `FROM`
line in your Dockerfile and package your application on top. For example:

```
FROM goern/grasshopper:0.3.0-pre

MAINTAINER Your Name <you@example.com>

ADD /Nulecule /application-entity/
ADD /Dockerfile README.asciidoc /
ADD /artifacts /application-entity/artifacts
```

To install your newly nuleculized application, simply call `atomic run myapp`.

For a description of the lifecycle of a Nulecule, please refer to https://github.com/dustymabe/atomicapp/blob/4355d26576ac1297db1889277a4045f8d025bc4e/docs/atomicapp_lifecycle.md

=== Prerequisites

Nulecules (aka "A Composite Container-based Application") are transferred as docker container images,
therefore Grasshopper needs to talk to a docker daemon (which in fact will pull the image) to fetch
docker container images.

On a Mac you should install http://docs.docker.com/mac/started/[Docker Toolbox], using the quick start terminal
a few environment variables will be set (DOCKER_HOST, DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY, DOCKER_CERT_PATH).

On a Fedora/CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux host, Grasshopper will talk to the local docker daemon
via `/var/run/docker.sock` or, if a few environment variables are set (DOCKER_HOST, DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY,
DOCKER_CERT_PATH) Grasshopper will talk to the remote docker daemon.

== Developers

image:https://travis-ci.org/goern/grasshopper.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/goern/grasshopper"]
image:https://coveralls.io/repos/goern/grasshopper/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github["Build Status", link="https://coveralls.io/github/goern/grasshopper?branch=master"]

First of all, clone the github repository: `git clone https://github.com/goern/grasshopper`.

=== Build

To build a Grasshopper base image just run `make image`, this will compile the
Grasshopper binary and generate a Docker container image containing it.

Grasshopper is also build on Fedora's wonderful COPR build service, therefor a
SPEC file is provided.

WARNING: Nevertheless a source RPM is provided containing all the source from
github, the rpm build process itself is using `go get` to get the source.

=== Test

There is a Makefile target called `test`, which will run all the GO tests. We aim
to keep the test coverage over 75%.
